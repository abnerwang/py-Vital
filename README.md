# py-VITAL
by [Xiaoping Wang](http://blog.keeplearning.group/about/) at USTC.  
## Introduction
Python (PyTorch) implementation of VITAL tracker. VITAL is a great tracker invented by Song, Yibing and Ma, Chao and Wu, Xiaohe and Gong, Lijun and Bao, Linchao and Zuo, Wangmeng and Shen, Chunhua and Lau, Rynson and Yang and Ming-Hsuan. This implementation is based on [py-MDNet](https://github.com/HyeonseobNam/py-MDNet), which is implemented by Hyeonseob Nam and Bohyung Han. Thanks to all of them.

## Prerequisites
- python 3.6+
- opencv 3.0+
- [PyTorch 1.0+](http://pytorch.org/) and its dependencies

## Usage

### Tracking
```bash
 python tracking/run_tracker.py -s DragonBaby [-d (display fig)] [-f (save fig)]
```
 - You can provide a sequence configuration in two ways (see tracking/gen_config.py):
   - ```python tracking/run_tracker.py -s [seq name]```
   - ```python tracking/run_tracker.py -j [json path]```
 
### Pretraining
 - Download [VGG-M](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-m.mat) (matconvnet model) and save as "models/imagenet-vgg-m.mat"
 - Pretraining on VOT-OTB
   - Download [VOT](http://www.votchallenge.net/) datasets into "datasets/VOT/vot201x"
    ``` bash
     python pretrain/prepro_vot.py
     python pretrain/train_mdnet.py -d vot
    ```
 - Pretraining on ImageNet-VID
   - Download ImageNet-VID dataset into "datasets/ILSVRC"
    ``` bash
     python pretrain/prepro_imagenet.py
     python pretrain/train_mdnet.py -d imagenet
    ```
